# Machine Learning - KServe Hosting ML Models

## KFServing Overview:

**Purpose:**
KFServing aims to provide a standardized and scalable solution for deploying, serving, and managing machine learning models in Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that allows for efficient deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Key Features:**

1. **Scalability:**
   - KFServing allows for the efficient scaling of ML model serving based on demand. It can automatically scale the number of serving instances up or down to handle varying workloads.

2. **Model Versioning:**
   - KFServing supports multiple versions of a model, enabling easy testing and deployment of new model versions. This facilitates gradual rollouts and A/B testing.

3. **Inference Acceleration:**
   - The framework often integrates with specialized hardware accelerators (such as GPUs) to optimize model inference, ensuring low-latency responses for real-time applications.

4. **Multi-framework Support:**
   - KFServing is designed to support models built with various machine learning frameworks, providing flexibility for data scientists and developers to use their preferred tools.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - KFServing typically includes monitoring and logging capabilities, allowing users to track the performance of deployed models, collect logs, and monitor resource usage.

6. **Integration with Kubernetes:**
   - Being designed for Kubernetes, KFServing seamlessly integrates with other Kubernetes components and can leverage features like auto-scaling and resource management.

7. **Cloud-Native:**
   - KFServing aligns with cloud-native principles, making it well-suited for deployment in cloud environments.

**How to Use:**
Users typically define a KFServing custom resource (such as a KFServing InferenceService) to deploy and manage a machine learning model. This resource specifies details like the model URI, serving runtime, and other configuration parameters.
